### Concourse Minion 4 Chrome

Disclaimer: Proof Of Concept - code is primitive and maybe it is missing lots of scenarios.

This is a simple tool to add some shortcut in your Concourse page. 

### Customize it

Go to `./manifest.json`

Change `$.content_scripts.matches` to add your concourse host you want to apply this extension.


### Install

Because it is not registered with a Chrome Extension developer account, you need to install as a developer

2. Activate Developer mode
3. Install unpacked extension
4. Select the root folder of this repo
